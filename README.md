Todo_REST_Silex
===============

A simple todo REST service with silex micro framework.


The application design is same as for [this one](https://github.com/papepapes/TodoApp_laravel_REST). So 
you can report to his readme for the doc. 
In both cases, the aim is to implement a REST service that can be used later each time that i discover a new front end framework 
(because there is a lot out there) to play with.
